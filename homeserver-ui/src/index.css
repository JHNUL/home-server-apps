/*
Tailwind needs to know which classes to include at build time so dynamically
generated classnames are a problem. The below safelists a sensible default
number of grid-cols-n classnames. If a grid of larger size is used via a 
dynamic classname then it'll just look all wrong. Not great, but since dynamic
column number resolution is done very much on purpose and the use case has
practical limits (used in Table, no table will have 20+ columns) this is fine
for now.

See: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files#safelisting-with-ranges
